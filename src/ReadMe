The system comprises three processes running on different IP addresses.

For the purpose of demonstration they are running on the loop-back network 127.0.0.?

The processes MUST be run in the following order:

RunPO2
RunPO1
RunSender

The system produces an unexpected error message:
org.codehaus.groovy.tools.RootLoader cannot be cast to jcsp.net2.mobile.DynamicClassLoader

This is generated deep inside the parallel jcsp library being used.

If the Processes are run as a collection of three parallel processes,
not distributed over a number of nodes using
RunSingleMachine
output is generated, albeit jumbled up, that is as expected.

The Java version used  is AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot
The Groovy version is org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.3.11

Up until mid-2018 I had been using Eclipse, using the latest version,
plus the corresponding Groovy Eclipse plugin.
This was generated using Java 1.8 and Groovy 2.4 plugin from springsource

In mid 2018 I moved to Intellij, later versions of Groovy and Gradle builds.

It was only in May 2019 did I discover that this error was being generated.

I am now trying to generate version of the libraries that are Java8 and Java9+ compatible.

I now realise that there is something more fundamental that I need to sort out
before moving on to te redevelopment for java9+
